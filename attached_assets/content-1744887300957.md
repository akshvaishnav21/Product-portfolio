Privacy Policy for “Call Your AI” Chrome Extension

Last updated: April 17, 2025

1. Introduction
“Call Your AI” (“we,” “our,” or “the Extension”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension uses permissions and handles data. By installing or using the Extension, you agree to the practices described herein.

2. Data Collection


No Personal Data: We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive information about you or your browsing activity.

Local Inputs Only: All queries you type (e.g. @chatgpt \[your query\]) are processed locally in your browser to determine which AI service to launch.

3. Permissions and Their Use

tabs / activeTab: Used solely to open or update browser tabs when you invoke an AI command (e.g. @claude \[your query\]).

webNavigation: Listens only to navigation events for tabs created by the Extension, ensuring actions (like focusing an input field) occur after a page fully loads.

host permissions: Limited to the specific AI domains you choose (e.g. [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/) _, [https://www.perplexity.ai/](https://www.perplexity.ai/)_), enabling the Extension to pre‑populate or guide text insertion when site policies allow.

storage: Stores only your custom keyword settings and enabled/disabled service preferences locally in Chrome; nothing is synced to external servers.

4. No Third‑Party Analytics or Tracking
We do not include any analytics, advertising, or telemetry libraries. There is no collection of usage metrics or sharing of data with third parties.

5. Data Security
All processing occurs on your device. There is no server‑side component. Your custom settings remain in your browser’s storage and cannot be accessed by us.
